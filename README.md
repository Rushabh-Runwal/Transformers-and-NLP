# Transformers and NLP Assignment

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks and video walkthroughs demonstrating:

✅ Inference with a pretrained classifier  
✅ Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone  
✅ Building and training a transformer from scratch  

- `videos/` → Video walkthroughs for each notebook  

## Structure

- [`inference_pretrained_classifier.ipynb` → Pretrained model inference  ]()
- [`[fine_tuning_pretrained_backbone.ipynb` → Fine-tuning example  ]()
- [`transformer_from_scratch.ipynb` → Custom transformer training  ]()

## Setup

1. Open notebooks in Google Colab  
2. Run cells following the comments  
3. Watch the corresponding video for a detailed explanation
